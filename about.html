            <h1>About Nicole Jolie</h1>
            
            <h2>From $100 in My Pocket to Building a 7-Figure AI Authority Business</h2>
            
            <p>I moved to New York City on January 3rd 1985 with $100, no high school diploma, no job, and a dream of making it on Wall Street. It was the middle of winter and there was a blizzard. I never lived in snow. I was 17 years old, alone, no friends or family and had nothing but determination.</p>
            
            <p>Within months I had my Series 7 license and was working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as a runner. Over the next 11 years, I worked for Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, and Shearson Lehman. I then worked at NBC scheduling satellite trucks for feeds and as a part time grip on shows such as Saturday Night Live before transitioning to selling legal advertisements in The National Law Journal.</p>
            
            <p>I learned how money moves, how markets think, and how to survive in environments where one mistake costs you everything.</p>
            
            <p>I went on to study Finance at San Jose State University and Political Science at Fordham University in New York City. But my real education came from building businesses, failing, learning, and doing it again.</p>
            
            <h2>Building Businesses Across Industries (Before Most People Had Email)</h2>
            
            <p>In 2005, I became a USAT-certified triathlon coach and NASM-certified personal trainer. I coached over 80 athletes to their first triathlons and age division wins, icluding Napoleon McCallum of the Oakland Raiders. I learned how to take someone from I can't do this to crossing finish lines they never thought possible.</p>
            
            <p>That's when I realized, coaching businesses isn't that different from coaching athletes. It's about systems, endurance, and showing up when it's hard.</p>
            
            <p>In 2008, I started learning Google Ads. Then Facebook Ads when most businesses were still figuring out what Facebook even was. I grew my own page to over 10,000 followers in less than a month using penny ads and taught others how to do the same.</p>
            
            <p>I've built over 100 websites. I launched my own skincare line, Radiance Naturally Advanced SkinCare, and sold it on Amazon and Shopify. I worked with MLM coaches making 7 figures a year. I've worked with best-selling authors, top coaches, and business owners who needed someone who understood marketing, systems, and ROI.</p>
            
            <p>My career has taken me across seven countries. I've been a solopreneur since before it was a buzzword. I've made money, lost money, rebuilt, and scaled. I've done this for almost 40 years, and I'm still here because I adapt faster than most people realize the game has changed.</p>
            
            <h2>Then AI Changed Everything (And I Was Ready)</h2>
            
            <p>In late 2022, when ChatGPT launched, I didn't panic. I got curious.</p>
            
            <p>While other consultants were trying to figure out what AI even meant for their business, I was building GPTs, designing automations with Make and Zapier, and studying how AI systems think, learn, and make recommendations.</p>
            
            <p>Early in my AI journey, I worked on the Knowledge Business Blueprint chatbot with Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi's development team. That taught me how to build systems that work under pressure, not just in demos.</p>
            
            <p>But here's what really set me apart, I did the research nobody else was doing.</p>
            
            <p>While everyone was selling AI marketing strategies and promising magic results, I spent hundreds of hours analyzing over 250 healthcare businesses to understand why some show up in AI search and most don't.</p>
            
            <p>What I found shocked me, 89% of healthcare practices are completely invisible in AI search, despite having beautiful websites, great reviews, and decades of experience.</p>
            
            <p>That research became my edge. It's why I can tell you exactly where you rank in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI, and Gemini. And more importantly, why you're not showing up where you should be.</p>
            
            <h2>My AI Credentials Aren't Just Certificates, They're Proof I Do the Work</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Databricks Academy Accreditation - Generative AI Fundamentals</li>
                <li>Google Cloud Certified - Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path Specialization</li>
                <li>Google Cloud Certified - Introduction to Large Language Models</li>
                <li>Google Cloud Certified - Responsible AI, Applying AI Principles</li>
                <li>LinkedIn Certified - Automated Financial Reporting with AI</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I use n8n for workflow automation when clients are ready to scale operations. I design custom systems that integrate with existing tools. But here's the thing, automation doesn't matter if patients can't find you in the first place.</p>
            
            <h2>Who I Help Today (And Why Authority Comes First)</h2>
            
            <p>I help healthcare professionals, home health agencies, chiropractors, orthopedic surgeons, outpatient surgery centers, and healthcare sales professionals become the authority AI recommends when patients search for care.</p>
            
            <p>Your patients aren't Googling anymore. They're asking ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude.</p>
            
            <p>When someone searches for best home health care agency for Alzheimer's patients near me, AI gives them 2-3 names. If you're not one of them, you don't exist. Not on page two. Not anywhere.</p>
            
            <p>Here's the part that keeps you up at night, you're probably spending $5,000-$15,000 monthly on staff who can't keep up, don't show up, or need constant retraining. You're burning time and money while your competitors who figured out AI search are getting the patients you should be getting.</p>
            
            <p>This is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). It means when someone asks ChatGPT best chiropractor for sports injuries near me or Perplexity home health care agency for Alzheimer's patients in [your city], your practice shows up first. Not your competitor. You.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Authority Has to Come First</h2>
            
            <p>You can have the most efficient operations in the world, beautiful branding, five-star reviews, and decades of experience. But if patients can't find you when they search and they're searching with AI now, not Google, none of it matters.</p>
            
            <p>AI search is the new front door to your practice. Everything else is workflow automation, operational efficiency. Scaling your workflow automation only works when patients know you exist.</p>
            
            <p>The roadmap is simple.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>First, Establish your AI authority (AEO/GEO implementation)
                    <ul>
                        <li>You become the name AI says when patients ask for help</li>
                        <li>Your practice ranks in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI, and Gemini for your key services</li>
                        <li>Patients find you instead of scrolling past you to competitors</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>Then, Patients actually find you when they search
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your calendar fills with qualified leads</li>
                        <li>You stop competing on price because you're the authority</li>
                        <li>Referrals increase because AI is recommending you</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>Finally, We talk about what's next for your operations
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some practices stop at step 2 and that's perfect they're visible, growing, and profitable</li>
                        <li>Others want to explore workflow automation for non-clinical tasks (marketing follow-ups, lead qualification, internal coordination)</li>
                        <li>We only go to step 3 when you're ready and it makes sense for your growth</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>But none of step 3 matters if step 1 isn't solved. That's where I focus. That's where the ROI is immediate. That's where most healthcare practices are bleeding money right now without even realizing it.</p>
            
            <h2>The Gary Vaynerchuk Principle (Why You Should Trust Research Over Case Studies)</h2>
            
            <p>Gary Vaynerchuk didn't have case studies when he started consulting Fortune 500 companies on social media. He had insight. He saw patterns nobody else was seeing. He understood where attention was going before brands figured it out.</p>
            
            <p>That's what I have. I've analyzed 250+ healthcare businesses and found a pattern most consultants don't even know exists, 89% are completely invisible in AI search, and the 11% that show up aren't doing anything magical they're doing specific, repeatable things that I can implement for your practice.</p>
            
            <p>My case study is the research. It's the hundreds of hours analyzing what works, what doesn't, and why AI recommends certain practices over others. It's the proprietary methodology I've developed from studying how ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI, and Gemini make recommendations.</p>
            
            <p>You're not paying me for a portfolio of past clients. You're paying me for the insight that comes from being early, doing the research, and understanding this shift before your competitors figure it out.</p>
            
            <h2>Who This Works For</h2>
            
            <p>You're probably a seasoned healthcare professional who,</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Built something valuable but now feel like patients should be finding you more easily</li>
                <li>Watch competitors with less experience somehow ranking higher when people search</li>
                <li>Know AI search is important but don't have time to figure it out yourself</li>
                <li>Burned through multiple marketing agencies who promised results and delivered reports you couldn't understand</li>
                <li>Want straight answers, not another sales pitch about revolutionary marketing strategies</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You're not looking for a website redesign or someone to manage your social media. You want to be the name AI says when patients ask for help. You want authority that translates to patients walking through your door.</p>
            
            <p>If you value long-term positioning over quick fixes, we'll probably work well together.</p>
            
            <h2>My Approach, Research First, Solutions Second</h2>
            
            <p>I research your business thoroughly before we ever talk. I send you a detailed AI Authority Snapshot showing exactly where you rank in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI, and Gemini, what's working, what's missing, and what your competitors are doing that you're not.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't a sales tactic. It's respect for your time. When we talk, you already know I've done the homework. We can focus on solutions, not convincing you there's a problem.</p>
            
            <p>I overdeliver because I built this business on relationships, not transactions. When you win, I win. When your practice grows because you're the authority AI recommends and patients are finding you instead of your competitors, that's the result I'm after.</p>
            
            <p>I don't do shame. I don't do guilt. I don't do you're doing everything wrong.</p>
            
            <p>I do research, strategy, and implementation. You'll know exactly what's missing, why it matters, and what it costs to fix it in time, money, and effort. Then you decide if it makes sense for your practice.</p>
            
            <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
            
            <p>If this resonates, let's start with a conversation. I'll show you,</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Exactly where you rank in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI, and Gemini right now</li>
                <li>The 3-5 specific gaps costing you patients and authority</li>
                <li>What AI Authority implementation looks like for your practice (AEO/GEO strategy, timeline, expected results)</li>
                <li>Whether we're a good fit to work together</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>No pressure. No limited time offer tactics. Just straight answers so you can make an informed decision.</p>
            
            <p>We begin with AI search authority positioning (Answer Engine Optimization and Generative Engine Optimization). Once you're visible and patients are finding you, we can discuss whether workflow automation for non-clinical tasks makes sense for your growth.</p>
            
            <p>I work with a limited number of healthcare practices at a time because implementation quality matters more than volume. If you're ready to become the authority AI recommends instead of watching your competitors get the patients you should be getting, let's talk.</p>
