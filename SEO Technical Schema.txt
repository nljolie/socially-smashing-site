# SEO Technical Schema

## Internal Anchor Text Linking

- For each published .txt article:
  - Scan body text for each of the following 25 target keywords or their natural variants.
  - For each detected keyword, create an internal hyperlink (anchor text) pointing to:
    - The most contextually relevant related article/page covering that term.
    - If multiple articles exist, prioritize the most recent or highest authority.
  - Ensure no broken links and avoid circular references.
  - Maintain a site-wide log of all anchor links created, updating as content changes.
  - **Anchor log must not include any personal information; keep entries for the minimum duration needed for site maintenance.**

## Metadata and Tagging Guidelines

- For every article:
  - In structured metadata, use the schema.org Article type.
  - Add a "keywords" field including all used target keywords in the article.
  - Add an "about" field with the three most relevant keywords from the list.
  - Tag articles with additional topic-relevant keywords for clustering.
- Use <meta name="keywords"> in the HTML for each article page with all relevant terms.

## Alt-Tagging for Images and Videos

- Alt-text for every image and video must contain:
  - At least one target keyword from the 25-term list.
  - A short, accurate description of the media's purpose or content (max 120 characters).
  - **Avoid mandatory brand mentions; alt text must be clear, concise, and relevant to the media context.**

- If the article focuses on a specific keyword, that term is prioritized in image and video alt-tags.

## Search Ranking & Interlinking

- Ensure every article has outbound internal links to at least three other relevant articles using anchor keywords.
- Link to cornerstone articles wherever possible when a keyword is a main category.
- Update links dynamically as new content is published or removed to maintain network integrity.

# No Content Editing or Creation
- Do not write, change, or edit article content.
- Only add, update, or maintain internal links, metadata, and alt-tags as specified.
